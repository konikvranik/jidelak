	<p>Congratulations!</p>
	<p>You have installed Jidelak application, which is ready to import
		templates of restaurants.</p>
	<p>Jidelak is designed as a viewer for the daily menu. The menu
		must be fetched from the website of the restaurant. In order the
		Jidelak knows where to load the menu and what each field on the
		website means there is needed a template.</p>
	<p>Templates are in XSL format and you can create them either, or
		download templates which someone has already prepared. For these
		purposes there is a discussion forum, where you will find these
		templates and instructions how to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jidelak/wiki/Home/">create your own template</a>.</p>
	<p>
		Forum is on this address: <a
			href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jidelak/discussion/templates/thread/34a9e7a5/">https://sourceforge.net/p/jidelak/discussion/templates/thread/34a9e7a5/</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Thank you for choosing Jidelak I wish you a good taste.</p>
	<p>
		PS: Anything you will miss in Jidelak, or if you hit the problem that
		can be addressed, please let me know via Issue tracking at <a
			href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jidelak/tickets/">https://sourceforge.net/p/jidelak/tickets/</a>.
